# LLM_Hotel_Booking_Analytics
Overview

This project is an LLM-powered booking analytics and QA system that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide booking insights and answer queries using a vector database. It integrates FastAPI for API endpoints and ChromaDB or FAISS for efficient search.

Features

📊 Analytics API: Generates revenue trends, cancellation rates, and geographical distribution reports.

🧠 Question Answering API: Uses RAG to search hotel booking data and generate responses with an LLM.

⚡ FastAPI-based Backend: Provides a scalable and high-performance API.

🏎️ FAISS / ChromaDB for Vector Search: Enables fast similarity search on booking data.

🤖 LLM Integration: Uses SentenceTransformers for embeddings and a transformer-based LLM for query responses.
